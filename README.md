# Heart-Disease-Classification-Decision-Trees-

## Objective:
* Using Decision Tree model to predict whether a patient has Heart Disease or not

## Dataset used: 
* Link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease
* Exact DataSet Link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/heart-disease/processed.cleveland.data

## Data Parameters:
* age
* sex
* cp - (Chest Pain)
* restbps - (Resting Blood Pressure)
* chol - (Cholestrol in mg/dl)-
* fbs - (fasting blood sugar)
* restecg - (resting electrocardiographic result)
* thalach - (Maximum heartrate achieved)
* exang - (Exercise induced angina)
* oldpeak - (ST Depression induced by excersise relative to eat)
* slope - (the slope of peak excersie ST segment)
* ca - (number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy)
* thal - (thalium heart scan)
* hd - (Heart Disease - the predicted attribute)

## Concepts
* Data Cleaning
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Leanring and creating Decision Tree
* Pruning the Decision Tree for better result
* Understanding Cost Complexity Pruning
* Understanding about Cross Validation
* Understanding overfitting of Decision Tree
